Unidirectional Data Flow

In React, application data flows unidirectionally via the state and props objects, as opposed to the two-way binding of libraries like Angular. This means that, in a multi component heirachy, a common parent component should manage the state and pass it down the chain via props.

Your state should be updated using the setState method to ensure that a UI refresh will occur, if necessary. The resulting values should be passed down to child components using attributes that are accessible in said children via this.props.

See this example that shows this concept in practice:
<script src="./vendor/react.js"></script>
<script src="./vendor/react-dom.js"></script>
<script src="./vendor/babel-browser.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/babel" src="./app.jsx"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="app.js"></script>
</body>
